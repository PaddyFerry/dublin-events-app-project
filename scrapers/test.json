In his early 20s, Mr. Hamell was the front man and writer for an original band, but local bands were a dime a dozen in the tough, working class neighborhoods in Syracuse, NY. So he launched a one-man act called \"Hamell on Trial.\"\n\nArmed with his battered 1937 Gibson acoustic guitar, Mr. Hamell toured the country, then settled in Austin, Texas, where he found a receptive audience for his esoteric mix of songs and story telling. In 1995, Mercury Records signed him straight out of the SXSW Music Conference and released Big as Life and The Chord is Mightier than the Sword.\n\nA few years later, and a move to Brooklyn, NY, brought Mr. Hamell and Ani DiFranco together. He signed with Righteous Babe Records and released Tough Love in 2003, followed by Songs for Parents Who Enjoy Drugs in 2006. Subsequently, he has toured extensively with Ms. DiFranco, and has collaborated with her on several songs.\n\nPerforming in and around the New York scene prompted Mr. Hamell to rediscover the roots of his hurricane-force musical style and authentic cutting edge world view. His response, The Terrorism of Everyday Life, is a one-man theatrical show which combines story telling, comedy and songs into a brilliantly outrageous theatrical event. Mr. Hamell explores family, politics, religion and death through his journey as a working musician, man of the street, and father of a young son.\n\nMr. Hamell was invited to perform at the 2007 Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland, where The Terrorism of Everyday Life earned five-star reviews in the Metro, Edinburgh Review, and Three Weeks, and was awarded the Festival\u2019s prestigious Herald Angel Award, the highest honor the Festival gives to the most outstanding performance each year\n\nClive Barnes- Is one of Irelands most unique 6 string performers on the Island."}, {"tickets": null, "pub_id": "52868287879", "scraper": "facebook", "name": "Speed Dating at McGowans", "time": "2018-02-15", "date": "22:00", "address": "CME Offices, Royal Canal Terrace, Arran Quay A ED, Dublin 7, Dublin, County Dublin, Leinster, D01 FW20, Ireland", "location": "McGowans of Phibsboro", "id": "1995527944042602", "description": "Ticket includes entry and 3 drinks on registration\r\nRegistration for this event is at the link below.

You will find yourself tapping your foot and nodding your head although you're \u201cnot really into reggae, I'm a metal guy\u201d. You will be happier than you thought you could be *. You will end up in places you didn't even know existed. And somehow you'll make it home safely with your keys, phone and wallet intact. Jaya the Cat will leave glitter confetti on your bedroom floor and take you out for breakfast. Or lunch, because, you know, breakfast will definitely be too early for anyone here. Originating in Boston, Jaya the Cat promptly relocated to Amsterdam, and with a crew of diverse and international musicians continue perfecting the art of making the most amazing musical cocktail possible to get you through this night and into the next one, with equal parts reggae, punk, and ska, a splash of electronics and a sprig of dub with a shot of whiskey on the side. In between a relentless touring schedule through clubs and festivals across Europe and beyond, that is downright confusing they keep up considering what they get up to, they've recently spent a month in Berlin recording their fifth studio full-length album set to be released in November 2017.  \u201cA Good Day For The Damned\u201d continues the path the band has put itself on with their previous releases. Winding down city streets and across moonlit beaches, staggering past carnivals and cemeteries and drunken sunrises, come 15 new tales of heartbreak and joy, political confusion and existential madness but in the end, overall optimism. The right concoction to get you in the mood for what this night holds. *Jaya the Cat will not be held liable for any implied happiness, unhappiness, drowsiness, nausea, fatalities, std's, lost and or stolen goods, broken bones or relationships, or anything really.

Polyphonic melodies sit on top of a bouncing rhythm section which serve to make audiences move their limbs, tighten their facial muscles and get loose.\n\n\"Grand were an unexpected delight setting the Animal Barn venue alight with a Jazz set to equal the best of the genre. Their searing trumpet crescendos, smooth jazz vocals, and plucky double bass were undeniable, taking their audience into an ecstatic hootenanny.\" - HotPress Magazine\n\nwww.grandbandlads.ie\n\n\n\nFibbers\nFeb 11th\nDoors 7pm\nTickets: \u20ac12 pre-sales available from tickets.ie\nhttps://secure.tickets.ie/Listing/EventInformation/36972/\n\n++++++++++++++++++\nVenture Presents\nJaya The Cat\nGRAND\nFibber Magees\ntickets.ie"}, {"tickets": null, "pub_id": "196256240443741", "scraper": "facebook", "name": "Industrial is Not Dead - Free Admission", "time": "2018-02-08", "date": "22:30", "address": "Findlater House, Findlater Place, Rotunda A ED, Dublin 1, Dublin, County Dublin, Leinster, D01 T2X2, Ireland", "location": "Fibber Magee's", "id": "1858524767511694", "description": "INDUSTRIAL IS NOT DEAD - FREE ADMISSION\n\nSTART YOUR WEEKEND EARLY WITH FACE MELTING, BOOT STOMPING INDUSTRIAL FROM RAMMSTEIN, PRODIGY, DEATHSTARS, COMBICHRIST, MARILYN MANSON, NINE INCH NAILS, SKINNY PUPPY, THE BIRTHDAY MASSACRE, ROB ZOMBIE, PSYCLON NINE, PITCHSHIFTER, MINISTRY, KMFDM, MINDLESS SELF INDULGENCE, :WUMPSCUT:, AMERICAN HEAD CHARGE, CELLDWELLER, COIL, DAS ICH, DOPE, DOPE STARS INC, EISBRECHER, FEAR FACTORY, FRONT LINE ASSEMBLY, GOTHMINISTER, GODFLESH, GODHEAD, HANZEL UND GRETYL, HOCICO, LAIBACH, MEGAHERZ, MNEMIC, OOMPH!,OMEGA LITHIUM, ORGY, PAIN, POWERMAN 5000, REVOLTING COCKS, SAMAEL, STATIC-X, STRAPPING YOUNG LAD, THE KOVENANT, THROBBING GRISTLE, TURMION K\u00c4TIL\u00d6T AND WHITE ZOMBIE.\n\nADMISSION FREE\nDRINK SPECIALS \nGOING ALL THE WAY TILL LATE\nFree Admission"}, {"tickets": null, "pub_id": "196256240443741", "scraper": "facebook", "name": "Cider Wasps at Fibber Magees w/ Future Stops", "time": "2018-02-08", "date": "20:00", "address": "Findlater House, Findlater Place, Rotunda A ED, Dublin 1, Dublin, County Dublin, Leinster, D01 T2X2, Ireland", "location": "Fibber Magee's", "id": "186791672057728", "description": "Cider Wasps at Fibber Magees Thursday 8th February. \n\nSupport from Future Stops. \n\nDoors 8.30pm. \nEntry \u20ac5."}, {"tickets": null, "pub_id": "1038092939643439", "scraper": "facebook", "name": "Drop Dead Twice: Ruth Mac / ELKIN / Fake Natty", "time": "2018-02-15", "date": "20:00", "address": "The Irish House Pub, Bertram Court, The Liberties, Merchants Quay B ED, Dublin 8, Dublin, County Dublin, Leinster, D08 TC6D, Ireland", "location": "Drop Dead Twice", "id": "373510296490806", "description": "Thursday 15th Feb \u2662 20.00 \u2662 \u20ac5\n\nRuth Mac\n\u2662\nELKIN\n\u2662\nFAKE NATTY"}, {"tickets": null, "pub_id": "1038092939643439", "scraper": "facebook", "name": "Heart Beach (Aust), Spongebob Eyelashes, Maija Sofia, Slouch", "time": "2018-02-10", "date": "20:00", "address": "The Irish House Pub, Bertram Court, The Liberties, Merchants Quay B ED, Dublin 8, Dublin, County Dublin, Leinster, D08 TC6D, Ireland", "location": "Drop Dead Twice", "id": "1812778645687882", "description": "HEART BEACH play live in the Taproom at Drop Dead Twice, Dublin on the 10th of February 2018. \n\nHeart Beach play sad, girl-guy, 9to5 pop songs.
